# Ads1256 class

Driver for fast 8 channel 24bit ADC converter from TI

* Goal: easy to port, light weight, full features, easy to use

* Status: works for arduino framework (reading raw values single or in bulk)

* Todo: 
        * make it a lib for arduino and platformio, 
        * convert raw to volts and with gain
        * class names without platform
        * bulk read: if in standby: wakeup first
